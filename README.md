#### About the author

My name is Antonio Leiva, I’m an Android Engineer and freelance trainer. Curiosity for discovering new concepts, and applying them to my daily work, led me to start studying Kotlin in Android before its final version was released. I help other developers become experts in Kotlin for Android through different training modalities.

In this online course, Kotlin for Android Developers, I share and **explain all the language concepts you need to create an app with Kotlin from scratch**.
